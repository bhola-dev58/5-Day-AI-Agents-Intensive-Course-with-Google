I might be able to provide more detail on that!\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are constant and exciting new developments in AI-driven drug discovery. It's one of the most dynamic areas of AI in healthcare. Here's a breakdown of some of the recent and ongoing trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n*   **Designing from Scratch:** Instead of just screening existing compounds, generative AI models (like those based on transformers or variational autoencoders) are now being used to design entirely *new* molecules with desired properties. They can explore chemical space in ways that were previously impossible, aiming for molecules that are more potent, selective, and have better pharmacokinetic profiles.\n*   **Target-Specific Design:** These models can be trained to generate molecules that specifically bind to a particular disease target (e.g., a protein implicated in cancer or Alzheimer's).\n\n**2. Enhanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n*   **Uncovering New Targets:** AI can analyze massive datasets (genomics, proteomics, patient data) to identify novel biological targets that play a role in disease. This is crucial because many diseases still lack effective drug targets.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI can help assess whether a newly identified target is \"druggable\" – meaning, can a small molecule or biologic drug effectively interact with it to produce a therapeutic effect.\n\n**3. Accelerating Pre-clinical Testing and Optimization:**\n*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models are getting better at predicting how well a drug candidate will work in living systems and its potential toxicity *before* expensive and time-consuming lab experiments or animal trials. This helps de-risk the development process.\n*   **Optimizing Drug Properties:** AI can suggest modifications to a lead compound to improve its solubility, stability, or how it's absorbed and metabolized by the body (ADME properties).\n\n**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze vast databases of drug information and disease mechanisms to identify existing drugs that could be effective for new indications. This is often a faster and less expensive path to new treatments.\n\n**5. Advancements in Protein Folding and Structure Prediction:**\n*   **AlphaFold and Beyond:** While AlphaFold (developed by DeepMind) was a breakthrough in predicting protein structures, ongoing work is refining these models and applying them directly to drug discovery. Knowing the 3D structure of a target protein is essential for designing molecules that bind to it.\n*   **Dynamic Protein Interactions:** AI is also being developed to understand how proteins interact dynamically, which is crucial for understanding disease pathways and designing drugs that modulate these interactions.\n\n**6. Improved Clinical Trial Design and Patient Selection:**\n*   **Predicting Trial Success:** AI can analyze historical clinical trial data and patient characteristics to predict the likelihood of success for a particular drug in a specific patient population.\n*   **Stratifying Patients:** AI helps identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to respond to a given treatment, leading to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n\n**Key Companies and Initiatives:**\n\nMany biotech startups and established pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI for drug discovery. Some notable examples include:\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its end-to-end AI platform for drug discovery and development.\n*   **Exscientia:** Uses AI to design new drug candidates and optimize them.\n*   **Atomwise:** Leverages deep learning for small molecule drug discovery.\n*   **Schrödinger:** A leader in physics-based computational chemistry that is integrating AI.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI and automation to identify new drug candidates.\n\n**Challenges and the Future:**\n\nDespite the rapid progress, challenges remain:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Access:** AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. High-quality, diverse, and well-annotated biological and chemical data are essential.\n*   **Validation and Reproducibility:** Rigorous experimental validation is always required to confirm AI predictions.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a particular suggestion can be difficult, which is important for scientific rigor and regulatory approval.\n*   **Integration into Existing Workflows:** Seamlessly integrating AI tools into traditional R&D processes takes time and effort.\n\nHowever, the trend is clear: AI is no longer a futuristic concept in drug discovery; it's a rapidly advancing and essential tool that is reshaping how we find and develop new medicines. It's leading to faster, more efficient, and potentially more effective drug development pipelines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Okay, you're interested in the **second development I mentioned for AI in drug discovery: Enhanced Target Identification and Validation.**\n\nThis is a critical area because before you can even start looking for a drug, you need to know what you're trying to hit. A \"target\" is typically a molecule (like a protein or gene) that plays a key role in a disease process. By developing a drug that can interact with this target, you can potentially alter the course of the disease.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing this stage:\n\n**1. Uncovering Novel Biological Targets:**\n\n*   **Mining Vast Biological Datasets:** Diseases are complex, and our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms is constantly evolving. AI excels at sifting through enormous datasets that would be impossible for humans to analyze comprehensively. These datasets include:\n    *   **Genomic Data:** DNA sequences, gene expression levels (which genes are turned on or off).\n    *   **Proteomic Data:** The types and amounts of proteins present in cells or tissues.\n    *   **Transcriptomic Data:** The RNA molecules that carry genetic instructions.\n    *   **Metabolomic Data:** The small molecules involved in metabolism.\n    *   **Clinical Data:** Patient records, symptoms, treatment responses, and outcomes.\n*   **Identifying Patterns and Connections:** AI algorithms can identify subtle patterns and correlations within this data that might indicate a previously unknown molecule's involvement in a disease. For example, AI might notice that a specific protein is consistently overexpressed in the tumors of patients who don't respond to current therapies. This protein could then become a new target.\n*   **Systems Biology Approach:** AI allows for a \"systems biology\" approach, where it doesn't just look at individual genes or proteins in isolation but rather how they interact within complex biological networks. This provides a more holistic understanding of disease.\n\n**2. Validating Targets - Is it Druggable?**\n\nOnce a potential target is identified, the next crucial step is to determine if it's a good candidate for drug development. This is where \"validation\" comes in, and AI is also proving valuable here:\n\n*   **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":** Not all disease-associated molecules are suitable drug targets. AI models can be trained to predict:\n    *   **Binding Potential:** Can a small molecule or antibody effectively bind to the target in a way that modulates its function? This often involves analyzing the target's 3D structure and its chemical properties.\n    *   **Essentiality vs. Redundancy:** Is the target essential for the disease process, or are there redundant pathways that would make targeting it ineffective?\n    *   **Off-Target Effects:** Could drugs targeting this molecule also interact with other unintended targets in the body, leading to side effects? AI can help predict these potential \"off-target\" interactions.\n*   **Prioritizing Targets:** With potentially thousands of biological molecules implicated in a disease, AI can help researchers prioritize which ones are most likely to yield a successful drug. This saves significant time and resources by focusing on the most promising avenues.\n*   **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:** AI can help build models that explain *how* a target contributes to disease. This deeper understanding is crucial for designing drugs that precisely address the root cause.\n\n**Why is this \"Enhanced\" by AI?**\n\n*   **Scale and Speed:** Traditional target identification often relied on manual literature reviews, hypothesis-driven research, and laborious experiments. AI can process orders of magnitude more data and identify connections much faster.\n*   **Unbiased Discovery:** AI can help overcome human biases that might lead researchers to focus on well-studied targets, potentially missing novel and unexpected avenues.\n*   **Predictive Power:** AI moves beyond simply describing what's observed to predicting what *might* be important or what *could* be targetable.\n\n**In essence, AI-driven target identification and validation is about using intelligent systems to:**\n\n*   **Find the \"needle in the haystack\"** of biological data to pinpoint novel molecules involved in disease.\n*   **Quickly assess if that \"needle\" is something we can actually build a drug to interact with** and if it's worth pursuing.\n\nThis development is foundational because without a good target, the entire drug discovery process cannot begin effectively. It's helping to broaden the scope of diseases we can tackle and accelerate the journey towards finding treatments.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The field of AI-driven target identification and validation is a rapidly evolving space, with a mix of specialized AI biotech companies, established pharmaceutical giants adopting AI, and academic research institutions playing a crucial role.\n\nHere are some of the key players and types of companies involved, categorized for clarity:\n\n**1.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
