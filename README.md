# 🤖 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google

I am excited to dive into the **Kaggle Google AI Agents Intensive Course**! This journey begins today, marking the start of a deep exploration into intelligent, autonomous systems. 🚀

This repository serves as my **personal learning journal, detailed notes, and space for all code experiments** conducted over the next five days. My focus is on understanding how AI agents evolve from foundational concepts to complex, production-ready multi-agent systems.

## 📅 Course Outline & Key Milestones

### 🗓️ Day 1: Agent Foundations
Kickstarting with the core principles of AI agents. I will explore their defining characteristics and how **agentic architectures** fundamentally differ from traditional LLM applications, enabling true autonomy.

---

### 🗓️ Day 2: Tool Integration & The Power of MCP
Focusing on giving agents the ability to **take action** using external tools and APIs. A key area will be the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**—a crucial framework for seamless tool discovery and integration to expand agent capabilities.

---

### 🗓️ Day 3: Context Engineering: Memory & State Management
Learning to build agents that possess **memory** and can maintain context across complex interactions. The goal is to implement robust **short-term and long-term memory** systems essential for handling multi-turn conversations and dynamic tasks.

---

### 🗓️ Day 4: Agent Performance & Quality Assurance
Understanding the critical aspects of agent reliability. This day is dedicated to learning how to **evaluate, monitor, and optimize** agent behavior, mastering **observability, logging, and tracing**, and defining key metrics for continuous improvement.

---

### 🗓️ Day 5: Scaling from Prototype to Production
The final step: taking a working agent **from a concept to a scalable deployment**. I will cover effective deployment strategies, scaling challenges, and explore the future of **multi-agent systems** powered by the **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts I'm Mastering

* Agentic architectures and true autonomy design
* Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool use
* Context engineering, sessions, and memory design
* Observability, logging, and robust evaluation frameworks
* Deployment, scaling, and the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol

---

## 🎯 My Personal Project Goals

By the end of this intensive, I aim to:

* Develop a functioning, context-aware AI agent prototype.
* Successfully integrate real-world tools using the MCP framework.
* Establish a clear methodology for evaluating and ensuring the reliability of agent behavior.
